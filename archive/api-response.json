I am re-reading Letters: Summer 1926, a collection of letters exchanged between Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetaeva, and Rainer Maria Rilke. In November 1922, Tsvetaeva wrote to Pasternak: “A letter is like an otherworldly communication, less perfect than a dream but subject to the same rules.”1 In August 1926, as Rilke’s leukemia worsened, Tsvetaeva sent him a letter proposing what could be read as an erotic encounter: “You are what I’m going to dream about tonight, what will dream me tonight.

Theoretically, it provides a kind of quality control, in which the piece you have written is vetted by two, sometimes three, experts in the field. As peer-reviewers retain an anonymity that is not generally extended to the authors of the work they evaluate, things are almost comically open to abuse—backscratching, nepotism, grudge-bearing, territorialism, partisanship, and so on, all presented in the most high-minded terms. On the whole, though, peer review can be ranked in the class of things that includes representative democracy: indefensible until you pause to consider the alternatives, and surprisingly effective at preventing the worst from coming to pass. The only place where peer review regularly comes unstuck is in confronting work that is genuinely new and transformative.

One of the major principles of extensive reading is that if a learner can comprehend material at 98% comprehension, she will acquire new words in context, in a painless, enjoyable way.

He argued that secularism is impossible, individualism is an illusion, and religious worship is inescapable. He made these arguments in best-selling books that combined learning and civility with a zeal for the ideals of democratic socialism and a dread for the practices of managerial capitalism.

It helps that grammar is simple, with few tenses and word endings; the vocabulary is small; the language is one of the deep cores of English, so reading it feels eerily familiar, like a song you half know. After being asked to read Fosse’s novel Melancholy in German, I decided to cotranslate it with a native Norwegian-speaker friend, and I have since translated, on my own, two more of Fosse’s novels—Aliss at the Fire and Morning and Evening—two stories, and a libretto. Jon Fosse is less well-known in America than some other Norwegian novelists, but revered in Norway—winner of every prize, a leading Nobel contender. I think of the four elder statesmen of Norwegian letters as a bit like the Beatles: Per Petterson is the solid, always dependable Ringo;","toRead":null,"createdDate":"2024-01-12T15:04:40.826Z","modifiedDate":"2024-01-12T15:04:47.464Z","lastCrawled":null},{"id":95593,"link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20190705130122/https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/07/05/carrying-a-single-life-on-literature-translation","title":"Carrying a Single Life: On Literature and Translation | by Teju Cole | NYR Daily | The New York Review of Books","favorite":false,"snippet":"You can enter multiple addresses separated by commas to send the article to a group; to send to recipients individually, enter just one address at a time. The English word translation comes from the Middle English, which originates from the Anglo-French translater. That in turn descends from the Latin translatus: trans, across or over, and latus, which is the past participle of ferre, to carry, related to the English word “ferry.” The translator, then, is the ferry operator, carrying meaning from words on that shore to words on this shore. Every work of translation carries a text into the literature of another language. Fortunate to have had my work translated into many languages, I am now present as an author in the literature of each of those languages. Dany Laferrière, in his 2008 novel I Am a Japanese Writer, expresses this slightly strange notion more beautifully than I can: When, years later I myself became a writer and was asked, “Are you a Haitian writer, a Caribbean writer or ","toRead":null,"createdDate":"2024-01-12T15:00:48.773Z","modifiedDate":"2024-01-12T15:01:54.108Z","lastCrawled":null},{"id":95590,"link":"http://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style","title":"Prof. Dr. Style","favorite":false,"snippet":"Every term I give an introduction to Interface Design studies to new students. 99% of them are under the delusion that the design of everything in the world is made in Photoshop or other Adobe products. In case the design is to be perceived on a computer, these Adobe files will be thrown into a room full of programmers who are longing to make it all interactive according to noble ideas embedded in the graphics. So the task is to show non-fictional challenges of new media and to explain why to study Interface Design. (To make it short here: interface designers develop projects that will be handed over to photoshoppers to put gradients on buttons.) Most of the students will not be convinced and will choose to study graphic design. Even those who want to be web designers. Though 17 years of the WWW show that you need quite a different skill set for that. That's why the last 3 hours given to me to influence people who will not study the web, but will design it anyway, I spent on highlighti","toRead":null,"createdDate":"2024-01-12T14:55:31.166Z","modifiedDate":"2024-01-12T14:55:39.922Z","lastCrawled":null}]}
