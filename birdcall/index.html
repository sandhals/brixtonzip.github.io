				<div class="a">I arrived at the HTML Energy day gathering a whopping four hours early today, and as I sat at the table thinking about what kind of site I should make, I thought it might be nice to remember the event by compiling the opinions and names of all the people who came to join.

					<p class="q">Some people believe that sounds have inherent qualities. Tell us your name, and, putting any etymologies or meanings aside, tell us your own interpretation of its sound. Is it more buoba? More kiki? A prickly name? A whispy one? Does its sound have a colour?</p>
					<p class="a">Brixton sounds like swift but heavy—like large stones falling on a granite beach, or the snap of an old, large tree branch.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">I saw a beautiful yellow house covered with grape vines, plants, and knick-knacks.</p>
					<p class="q">The space we're gathered at is called "Birdcall." Do you have a personal favourite bird call?</p>
					<p class="a">It’s a call you can hear in the springtime in Japan from a bird called an “uguisu.” The sound reminds me of a large rain droplet falling into water.</p>
					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>
					<p class="a">I like to check if it has a custom selection colour.</p>
					<p class="q">What's your favourite HTML colour?</p>
					<p class="a">Maybe tomato?</p>
					<p class="q">How about your favourite HTML tag?</p>
					<p class="a">The &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; tags.</p>
					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">Yokoo Tadanori. I think he would make a fantastic site.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">I think they will become more grounded in place. Introductions of neighborhoods, catalogues of cafes, digital archives of my belongings and home.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them. What is something you think HTML could be used for that we haven't really explored yet?</p>
					<p class="a">I think websites could make good gifts.</p>
					<p class="q">It's time to say goodbye! But I'd like to keep in touch. Do you have a website?</p>
					<p class="a">I do! Come say hello at

					<p class="a">Jisu sounds like seesaw.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">I saw a chocolate shop.</p>

					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>
					<p class="a">I look for a tiny rabbit hole.</p>
					<p class="q">What's your favourite HTML colour?</p>
					<p class="a">oldlace</p>
					<p class="q">How about your favourite HTML tag?</p>

					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">Ken Isaacs.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">I would like to update my current sites until then.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them.

					<p class="a">It could be used as a postcard!</p>
					<p class="q">It's time to say goodbye! But I'd like to keep in touch. Do you have a website?</p>
					<p class="a">Yes, websitesite.xyz!</p>

					<h1 class="name" id="nari">nari</h1>
					<p class="q">Some people believe that sounds have inherent qualities. Tell us your name, and, putting any etymologies or meanings aside, tell us your own interpretation of its sound. Is it more buoba? More kiki? A prickly name? A whispy one? Does its sound have a colour?</p>
					<p class="a">My name, Naree, doesn't have a direct meaning, but it sounds like "joy" in Korean. I think of it as a bright name, and it has a yellow color.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">The tiles at Gyeongbokgung Station looked like trees.</p>
					<p class="q">The space we're gathered at is called "Birdcall." Do you have a personal favourite bird call?</p>
					<p class="a">I like the bird calls that I usually hear at my studio. I don’t know the names of the birds, though.</p>
					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>

					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">They interpret and work with building materials in different ways, which leads me to imagine how they might use HTML tags creatively in their designs.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">Making websites with various font sizes depending on my age.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them. What is something you think HTML could be used for that we haven't really explored yet?</p>
					<p class="a">Linking the digital with the real world, for instance, creating interactive experiences like forming a band where everyone plays using their own instrument files like guitar.html or drum.html, and performing together.</p>
