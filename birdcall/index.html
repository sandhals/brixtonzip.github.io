				<div class="q">Today is <a href="http://html.energy">HTML Energy</a> Day! Having mistaken the time, I arrived far too early to the Seoul meet-up. I was able to make some small-talk with the people at <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/birdcall/">Birdcall</a> in Seoul, and as I spoke to them, at some point I decided that the site I wanted to build that day for the event would be a questionnaire. Something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire">Proust Questionnaire</a>, but for HTML. There are <a href="questionnaire/english.rtf">only ten questions</a> but I hope they were fun to answer. Below are some of the responses from the day's participants!

				오늘은 <a href="http://html.energy">HTML Energy</a>의 날입니다! 시간을 착각한 탓에 서울 모임에 너무 일찍 도착하고 말았습니다. 나는 서울의 <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/birdcall/">버드콜</a>에서 사람들과 가벼운 대화를 나누었고, 대화를 나누던 중 그날 행사에서 만들고 싶었던 사이트를 설문지로 만들기로 결정했습니다. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire">프루스트 설문지</a>와 같은 형태지만 HTML에 관한 것입니다. <a href="questionnaire/korean.rtf">단 10개의 질문</a>만 있지만 답하는 재미가 있었기를 바랍니다. 아래는 그날 참여자들의 답변 중 일부입니다!

					<p class="q">Some people believe that sounds have inherent qualities. Tell us your name, and, putting any etymologies or meanings aside, tell us your own interpretation of its sound. Is it more buoba? More kiki? A prickly name? A whispy one? Does its sound have a colour?</p>
					<p class="a">Brixton sounds swift but heavy—like large stones falling on a granite beach, or the snap of an old, large tree branch.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">I saw a beautiful yellow house covered with grape vines, plants, and knick-knacks.</p>
					<p class="q">The space we're gathered at is called "Birdcall." Do you have a personal favourite bird call?</p>
					<p class="a">It’s a call you can hear in the springtime in Japan from a bird called an “uguisu.” The sound reminds me of a large rain droplet falling into water.</p>
					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>
					<p class="a">I like to check if it has a custom selection colour.</p>
					<p class="q">What's your favourite HTML colour?</p>
					<p class="a">Maybe tomato?</p>
					<p class="q">How about your favourite HTML tag?</p>
					<p class="a">The &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; tags.</p>
					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">Yokoo Tadanori. I think he would make a fantastic site.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">I think they will become more grounded in place. Introductions of neighborhoods, catalogues of cafes, digital archives of my belongings and home.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them. What is something you think HTML could be used for that we haven't really explored yet?</p>
					<p class="a">I think websites could make good gifts.</p>
					<p class="q">It's time to say goodbye! But I'd like to keep in touch. Do you have a website?</p>
					<p class="a">I do! Come say hello at

					<p class="a">Jisu sounds like seesaw.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">I saw a chocolate shop.</p>

					<p class="a">piew piew.</p>
					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>
					<p class="a">I look for a tiny rabbit hole.</p>
					<p class="q">What's your favourite HTML colour?</p>
					<p class="a">oldlace</p>
					<p class="q">How about your favourite HTML tag?</p>
					<p class="a">&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">Ken Isaacs.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">I would like to update my current sites until then.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them. What is something you think HTML could be used for that we haven't really explored yet?</p>
					<p class="a">It could be used as a postcard!</p>
					<p class="q">It's time to say goodbye! But I'd like to keep in touch. Do you have a website?</p>
					<p class="a">Yes, <a href="http://websitesite.xyz">websitesite.xyz</a>!</p>

					<h1 class="name" id="nari">nari</h1>
					<p class="q">Some people believe that sounds have inherent qualities. Tell us your name, and, putting any etymologies or meanings aside, tell us your own interpretation of its sound. Is it more buoba? More kiki? A prickly name? A whispy one? Does its sound have a colour?</p>
					<p class="a">My name, Naree, doesn't have a direct meaning, but it sounds like "joy" in Korean. I think of it as a bright name, and it has a yellow color.</p>
					<p class="q">It's nice to meet you! It's a beautiful day today. Did you see anything that caught your eye on your way here today?</p>
					<p class="a">The tiles at Gyeongbokgung Station looked like trees.</p>
					<p class="q">The space we're gathered at is called "Birdcall." Do you have a personal favourite bird call?</p>
					<p class="a">I like the bird calls that I usually hear at my studio. I don’t know the names of the birds, though.</p>
					<p class="q">We've all gathered here today at Birdcall to talk about, appreciate, and create things with HTML. As someone who uses HTML yourself, when you first visit a site, what are some details you find yourself looking for?</p>

					<p class="q">Who are some non-HTML artists who inspire the way you make or think about websites? Do you think would make/would've made good web masters?</p>
					<p class="a">They interpret and work with building materials in different ways, which leads me to imagine how they might use HTML tags creatively in their designs.</p>
					<p class="q">How do you imagine the way you make sites will change as you grow older? What sort of sites do you want to be making when you are old and grey?</p>
					<p class="a">Making websites with various font sizes depending on my age.</p>
					<p class="q">HTML is powerful and beautiful, a tool and a language. Like all tools and languages, HTML is defined by the way we use it, and like tools and languages, boundaries and limits emerge around them as we use them. What is something you think HTML could be used for that we haven't really explored yet?</p>
					<p class="a">Linking the digital with the real world, for instance, creating interactive experiences like forming a band where everyone plays using their own instrument files like guitar.html or drum.html, and performing together.</p>
					<p class="q">It's time to say goodbye! But I'd like to keep in touch. Do you have a website?</p>
