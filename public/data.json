People from small towns could connect with like-minded individuals across the globe, overcoming geographical barriers and finding solace in a sense of community. People in big cities could start companies from their basements and get venture funding if they understood how the internet worked. You didn't need a degree, and you didn't need a sponsor. You just needed to be interesting. Wake up. The world that once welcomed outsiders and eccentrics is gone. We'll spend the next few years reminiscing about it with nostalgia, never quite capturing the same feeling. Offline is the new online, and we're currently at the beginning of a drastic shift in how we socialize.

Death is a cataclysm that can prove resistant to language.  This is the case in life. It is also the case (to a lesser extent) in The Waves.

Since the Enlightenment, educational reformers had sought to revive the Greek gymnastic ideal, summarized by the Roman poet Juvenal as mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body).

Or could it have something to do with Norwegian habits of self-portraiture and the way that books made in Norway tend to correspond to expectations and demands elsewhere?

When I ask about a work‚Äôs ‚Äòtranslatability,‚Äô I don‚Äôt mean whether a perfect copy of a poem can exist in a foreign language, but whether its translation can itself be a work of literature.  Besides, it would be insufficient if I were to say that Celan‚Äôs poems were translatable.  Rather, I had the feeling that they were peering into Japanese. After I had learned to read German literature in the original, I realised that my impression hadn‚Äôt been illusory. I was occupied even more than before by the question of why Celan‚Äôs poems were able to reach another world that lay outside the German language.
