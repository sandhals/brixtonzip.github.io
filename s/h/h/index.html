<h1>Lussekatter</h1>
<p>You found my secret page!! I feel like the internet used to be full of a lot more Easter eggs. I miss that simple sense of magic and mystique a page could give you when you stumbled upon a secret like that, so I wanted to try and include one on my own site!</p>
<p>I may change the secret later, but for now I thought I would make it this recipe for lussekatter that I enjoy around Christmas every year. Every evening on December 13, as part of a feastday called Luciadagen, Norwegians and Swedes eat delicious, fluffy, fragrant saffron buns called lussekatter.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 tsp saffron threads</li> 
    <li>400 ml (1 3/4 cup) milk</li>
    <li>2 tsp instant yeast (2.25 tsp active dry yeast, 17.5g fresh yeast)</li>
    <li>6 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    <li>750 grams (6 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>70 grams (5 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 egg for egg wash</li>
    <li>Raisins (for decoration)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Grind the saffron threads as finely as possible using the back of a spoon or if you have one, a mortar and pestle. Warm up about 57 ml (1/4 cup) of milk and pour over the saffron, stirring well. Leave this to steep/dissolve for at least 1-2 hours, until the majority of the saffron has dissolved. You may have to reheat the milk to keep it warm which will help it dissolve a little faster.</li>
<li>Heat the remaining milk, in the microwave or a saucepan, until it is “fingervarm” (finger warm), meaning it should feel warm to the touch but not hot. Add your yeast and 1 tbsp of sugar, stir, and leave it for 5-10 minutes until the mixture starts to bubble up, meaning your yeast is alive and not expired.</li>
<li>Add the salt, remaining sugar (5 tbsp), saffron mixture, egg, and egg yolks to a large bowl and mix well. Once the yeast mixture has bubbled up a bit, add it to the egg mixture. Mix well.</li>
<li>Slowly add the flour and softened butter, mixing with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to come together.</li>
<li>Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky; it should be soft and smooth, not too sticky nor too dry. Use a stand mixer if you would prefer!</li>
<li>Cover the dough with cling film or a clean dishtowel and let rise for about an hour or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Once the dough has doubled in size, divide into 16 equal sized pieces.</li>
<li>Begin shaping the buns by rolling out each piece into a log.</li>
<li>Then, curl one end inward until you reach the middle, and repeat in the opposite direction on the other side making an S-shape.</li>
<li>Place the buns on a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat and cover to let rise for another 45 minutes to an hour until doubled in size. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C).</li>
<li>Once ready, make an egg wash by combining an egg with a little bit of water and whisking together.
Buns after rising.</li>
<li>Brush the buns with the egg wash and place a raisin on top of each swirl (2 per bun). You can also top with pearl sugar, but this is optional!</li>
<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes until the buns are lightly golden. Enjoy these sweet rolls with a cup of tea or just on their own!</li>
